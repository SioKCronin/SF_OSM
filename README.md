# SF Open Street Map

[Project Details](https://siokcronin.github.io/SF_OSM/sf_map_clean.html)

In this project I vetted the viability of San Francisco Open Street Map data as a useful source in identifying physically accessible facilities. While my analysis indicated that it is not, I did idenfity that this resource could be an effective tool in building commercial transportation routes.
